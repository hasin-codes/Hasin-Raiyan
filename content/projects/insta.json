	"overview": "What if you could use Instagram while exploring a virtual world? That was the idea that sparked my UI design project for the Apple Vision Pro VR headset. Using Adobe XD, I set out to create a version of Instagram that feels like it's built right into the VR experience.  Think transparent menus, easy navigation, and the ability to see your feed without losing sight of your surroundings.",
	"content": [
		"Designing for VR is a whole new ballgame! Forget about tapping a screen â€“ I had to make the interface work with how people naturally move and interact within a virtual space.  The goal was to make Instagram feel like a seamless part of your VR world, not something that takes you out of the experience. This project was a super fun way to push the boundaries of UI design and I'm excited to see where VR takes social media in the future!"
