	"overview": "I took a shot at redesigning the user interface (UI) for Nagad, a popular Bangladeshi mobile financial service. Inspired by the glassmorphism trend, I focused on creating a visually stunning and contemporary look. My goal was to elevate the app's visual appeal while maintaining a clean and intuitive user experience.",
	"content": [
		"The redesign features the frosted-glass effect of glassmorphism, paired with soft gradients and vibrant colors for a modern feel.  Careful attention was paid to layout and button placement to ensure that the beauty of the design didn't compromise usability.  The result is a Nagad UI that feels both fresh and familiar, making financial tasks more engaging for users."
