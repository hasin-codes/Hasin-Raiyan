	"overview": "I took on the challenge of redesigning the Spotify mobile app using Adobe XD.  While staying true to Spotify's familiar color scheme, I aimed to give the interface a cleaner, more modern look. My focus was on sharpening the user experience (UX), making key features more intuitive and navigation a breeze.",
	"content": [
		"This project was all about balancing the iconic Spotify look with fresh design elements. Small tweaks to the layout, iconography, and menu structure can make a big difference in how smoothly users move through the app. The result is a streamlined Spotify experience that maintains the brand's identity while offering a touch of visual and functional refinement."
