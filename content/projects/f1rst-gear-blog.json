	"overview": "I'm the founder, CEO, and head strategist at F1RST GEAR. I also helped design our new F-commerce blog! We wanted it to be super simple and easy to read. So, we built it using HTML and only upload our very best content.  The goal is a clean space where we can share ideas, updates, and helpful stuff that goes along with our store.",
	"content": [
		"Sometimes, the simplest way is the best way â€“ that's why we love our HTML blog. It keeps us focused on sharing only what's truly important to our customers. The design puts the spotlight on the content, not a lot of flashy extras. Our blog is meant to add value to our F-commerce store, not steal the show. If you're looking for a straightforward way to connect with your customers, consider a simple HTML blog!"
