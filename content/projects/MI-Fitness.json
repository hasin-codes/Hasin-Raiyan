	"overview": "I took on the challenge of designing a VR fitness app with Mi Fitness VR. Using Adobe XD,  I prioritized a seamless user experience (UX) and a sense of visual transparency.  The goal was to create an app that allows users to fully immerse themselves in their virtual workouts while easily accessing workout data and controls.",
	"content": [
		"Designing for VR requires a fresh approach. I focused on clean, see-through menus and controls that don't obscure the virtual workout environment. This keeps users engaged in the experience. Mi FItness VR's intuitive interface allows for effortless navigation, workout selection, and progress tracking, further enhancing the workout experience within the VR space."
