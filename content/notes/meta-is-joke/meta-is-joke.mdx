# Where "Free Palestine" Makes You a Terrorist - How META Became a Joke

Years of sweat poured into building startups, software, and a vibrant online community – all extinguished in an instant by Meta's iron fist. My crime? Daring to speak for justice, for Palestine.  Mark Zuckerberg, once a symbol of progress, now resembles a censorious emperor, throttling free speech with his opaque algorithms.

## Biased Algorithms
The algorithms at play here are deeply flawed. Posts advocating for Palestinian rights or Islam are branded as terrorism, while hate speech runs amok unchecked. Meta has crafted a twisted world, where dissent is squashed, and bigotry thrives.

## The Frustration of Staying

We get it. You've heard the complaints. You've seen the outrage. Yet, here we are, still on Meta's platform. Why? Because let's face it, tearing down Zuckerberg's empire isn't a one-person job. Our families, friends, colleagues – they're all here. It's the digital town square, the forum where connections are made and information is shared. Leaving Meta feels like leaving a whole world behind.

## Society's Slumber: A Wake-Up Call

Society is in a state of complacency. We idolize Zuckerberg while demonizing champions of free speech like Elon Musk. Why? Because challenging the norm is uncomfortable. It's easier to follow the herd than to fight for justice. Zuckerberg capitalizes on this inertia, camouflaging his tyranny as normalcy.


## Hypocrisy Unmasked: Meta's Double Standards

The hypocrisy is maddening. Meta vilifies anyone showing support for Palestine or displaying its flag. Solidarity leads to bans, shadowbans, or outright deletion. This isn't about safety; it's about controlling the narrative, molding an echo chamber for their approved voices.

## Refusing to be your pawns, fuck you zuck
