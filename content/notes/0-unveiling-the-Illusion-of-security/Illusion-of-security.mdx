Unveiling the Illusion of Security
---
What if I told you that gaining access to someone's online account and seizing control of their digital life could be as simple as asking them for their password? If that sounds too far-fetched to be true, then read this blog real quick. 

# Here is a true example
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/opRMrEfAIiI?si=uDvfFXMSfkmSC7TY&amp;clip=UgkxEGo7UfdvFotEYzeNRTMN7rv4OTSsFduJ&amp;clipt=EIrLAhi7ggQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

What youâ€™ve just witnessed is a powerful yet often underestimated technique called social engineering. This method is frequently used by security researchers to breach even the most secure systems in the world. In this blog, I'll help you understand how this technique works by walking you through some common psychological flaws that make all of us vulnerable to these attacks.

## Trust & Authority:
Trust and authority are concepts that hold universal significance for humans. When an authoritative figure, such as your boss or teacher, requests you to plug a USB into your laptop to assist with a task, the likelihood of suspecting malicious intent, like installing malware, is considerably low.
This explains why the person being interviewed at the start of the video simply answered the questions asked, without considering that a professional TV show might attempt to hack her account. Establishing a sense of authority over someone can be challenging, but doing so increases the chances of success for an attacker by 80%, making the effort worthwhile.
## Fear of Missing Out aka FOMO
Another psychological flaw that hackers and even YouTubers exploit is called Fear of Missing Out, or FOMO. To understand what I mean, consider what Iman Gadzhi said in one of his videos.
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ST6UteJtjz0?si=oE96JuRbxRFy7nbx&amp;clip=UgkxjnTkqJTgFm7RxqtIZ6eg6yE0gTl5DXKs&amp;clipt=EAAYpHo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
So just as hearing the hook of this video might compel you to keep watching and find out why reading these famous books that everyone keeps talking about won't make you rich, a hacker can also persuade someone to click on a link if they don't want to miss out on something big. This feeling of impending urgency can lead to hasty decision-making. Another tactic used by hackers or social engineers is reciprocity and the norm of reciprocity. We all have a natural desire to show our gratitude to those who have helped us, and this is another thing that hackers exploit. They manipulate us into feeling obligated through the use of things like small favors, compliments, or gifts, making us more likely to comply with dubious requests rather than rejecting them outright. For example, "You went all the way to New York City to get us bagels? Oh, why isn't there a place closer that serves them?"
##Emotional Manipulation :
Social engineering can also be used to trigger a person's emotions 
In order to illustrate this let me show you another clip of a journalist at Defcon challenging a hacker to hack him

In conclusion, the swift acquisition of personal information by Jessica in just 30 seconds highlights the effectiveness of social engineering tactics employed by hackers. By exploiting the innate desire to assist others and adding a layer of authenticity to their approach, hackers can manipulate individuals, especially when urgency or consequences are emphasized. It's crucial to stay vigilant against such tactics by educating oneself about common social engineering strategies used by hackers. By building awareness and understanding these tactics, individuals can bolster their defenses and protect themselves against potential exploitation. Keep in mind that staying informed and proactive is key to safeguarding personal information and mitigating cybersecurity risks. 
That's the Wrap,
